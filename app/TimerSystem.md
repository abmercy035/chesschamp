Manual Process: Too many steps (find match → accept → create game)
No Notifications: No real-time alerts when matches are found
No Match History: Can't see previous matchmaking attempts
Limited Filters: Can't specify time controls, game types, etc.
3. Technical Limitations:
No WebSocket Integration: Should use real-time updates
No Match Validation: Doesn't check if opponent is still available
Basic ELO Algorithm: Simple ±100/200/300 ranges, not sophisticated
No Priority System: Doesn't prioritize better matches
4. Missing Features:

🎯 DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY MATRIX
🚨 CRITICAL (Must have for MVP)
Chess Engine Integration - Without this, it's not chess
Move Validation System - Core game functionality
Basic Wallet System - For staking feature
Win Condition Detection - Complete games properly
🟡 IMPORTANT (Phase 2)
User Profiles & Statistics
Rating/Ranking System
Tournament Basic Framework
Achievement System Foundation
🟢 NICE TO HAVE (Phase 3)
Advanced Tournament Features
Social Features (chat, friends)
Mobile App Development
Advanced Analytics
💡 Bottom Line
You've built 25% of a chess platform - specifically the realtime multiplayer infrastructure which is actually the hardest part! Your foundation is solid, but you're missing:

The actual chess game (75% of remaining work)
The financial/staking system (essential for your business model)
Competitive features (what makes users come back)
Next steps should focus on chess engine integration first, then wallet system, then competitive features. The technical infrastructure you have is genuinely impressive - now it needs game logic!
